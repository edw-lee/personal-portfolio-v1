My journey in coding started in 2015 when I first discovered an Augmented Reality plugin for Unity and was obsessed with developing an AR mobile game despite not knowing programming at the time. Soon after, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science and after I’ve graduated, I started working as a software engineer. So far, I’ve built software for an [**animation company**](https://ed-online.com.my/), a [**game development company**](https://www.gameka.my/site/) and a [**fintech company**](https://www.excelforce.com.my/).

Currently, I am working at [**Snovations**](https://www.snovations.com/), building software and web applications for clients. During my free time, I’ll venture into other fields of programming such as robotics and game development. Besides computer work, I also enjoy learning to play guitar, watch movies and occasionally hiking at nearby hiking trails.

I am always looking forward to new and exciting projects that allow me to add value through the software that I’ve created and improve my skills as a web developer.
